Week 5 - Exercises
Follow the instruction for each one of these exactly. If it says "a function that..." you need to write a function with the code inside it. 
If it says "a variable..." then you just make a variable, without a function. 
This way you can write one, then call the function from the console to test it. 
Or call the function right after where you wrote it, and then when you're done testing it, comment out the function call.
Either way, when you move on to the next one, your console wonâ€™t be cluttered up by the last.
Unless otherwise stated, all these functions need logical names. Remember to name them based on what they do.

// A function that receives 2 arguments (numbers), adds them together, and console logs the answer.


// A function that receives 1 argument (numbers), multiplies it by 2, and returns the answer.


// A variable set to an array of strings, each one a common first name.


// A function that console logs the first item in an array (the array you created above), then takes that item and moves it 
// to the back of the array. Calling the function over and over should log each item in the array in turn, going back to the 
// start after the last item, infinitely.


// A variable set to an array of numbers.


// A function that finds the highest number in an array of numbers and console logs it.


// A function that receives two strings, trims them (look it up), and then returns true if they match AND are not empty, 
// otherwise returns false. This is a common function used in user registration forms, for the password and password again fields.


// A function that rounds any number to the nearest multiple of 42 and returns it. This one has some math in it.


// A function that logs â€œThe answer to the question is â€ followed by whatâ€™s returned from the above function with 37 
// as the argument.


// A function that receives one argument, and logs something different depending of if the number is above 212, below 32, 
// or in between. 


// A function that receives 3 strings, a noun, a verb, and an adjective, and logs a sentence constructed with those words 
// inserted.


// A function that receives one argument, an array, and returns true if the array has more than 3 items, false if not.


// A function that receives one argument, an array of numbers, and returns true if any item in the array equals 42.


// A function that receives two arguments, a number and a string, and logs the string to the console the number of times 
// in the number argument.


// A function that console logs a phrase that gets funnier to more you read it.


// A function that sets a timeout for 5 seconds, which calls the above function.


// A function that has a loop that happens 5 times, and each time it sets a timeout, each timeout a different random length 
// between 1 and 5 seconds, to call the funny phrase function. (look up Math.random for random number generation)


// A variable set to an array containing every letter in the alphabet (as strings) and every number for 0 through 9.


// A function that picks a random item from the above array and returns it.


// A function that calls the above function 8 times, each time adding the returned value to a string, generating an eight 
// character long random alphanumeric string.


// A variable called counter, thatâ€™s just the number 0.


// A function that adds 0.5 to that last number variable, then console logs it, but only if the number is still below 1000.


// A function that sets an interval for 1/30th of a second to call that last function. Once you get that working, 
// consider how you might use logic like this to animate something on a webpage, such as the css left value of an element, 
// making it slide to the right. Yep, animation is not really that complex.


// A function that cancels that timeout. Obviously, youâ€™ll need to call it pretty quickly after starting the timeout to see the effect.


// Bonus: Here's some code to fetch a DIV from the DOM, and adjust it's css left value. 
// Work that into your interval function to make some animation happen.
	// document.getElementById("myDiv").style.left = "100px";
